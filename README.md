# liballthemibs

A curated library of SNMP SMI/MIB pulled from the nethers of the interwebs

## ./submitted

This directory contains all known MIBs, as new MIB files are found they are
added to this directory. These are only here for documentation purposes and
are not considered usable. Use at your own risk.

## ./snmp/mibs

Once someone has validated the MIB is parsable and loading causes no conflicts 
with other MIBs in the current database, they are migrated here with a pull
request.

# Contact
