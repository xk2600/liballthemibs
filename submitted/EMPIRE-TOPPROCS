                     value is highly system-dependent, it is usually
                     determined by calculating the difference in the
                     number of CPU ticks and dividing by the total
                     possible CPU ticks.  Since fractions are not
                     supported by SNMP, the value reported is
                     percentage multipled by 100.  For example, a CPU
                     percentage of 1.37 would be returned as 137."
