   DESCRIPTION
         "
         The public Ethernet access software supports a number of standard 
         and proprietary MIBs. This MIB module defines objects for
         reading/writing common Ethernet information.

         In cases where the network element is overloaded with traffic, it
         must be ensured that the high priority packets are always processed
         first. This is done using an overload protection mechanism that is
         always active. The downstream traffic from the aggregate uplink
         Ethernet will be processed according to priority. The overload
         protection is only in use if there is more than one packet waiting
         to be processed. There are a number of receive priorities in the
         network element downstream overload protection. This MIB can be
         used to configure the mapping between VLAN priority of downstream
         packets and the receive priority in the network element. Statistics
         for the receive priorities can also be read with this MIB.

     With this parameter it is possible to read the number of available receive
     priorities, which can be used when mapping VLAN tagged incoming downstream
     packets from the aggregation network to different receive priorities.

     vlanPrioToRxPriorityMappingTable is used to do the actual mapping between
     VLAN priority and receive priority.

    DESCRIPTION
    "
     Different operators uses different VLAN p-bit classification of services.
     In addition to voice, video and best effort data services, it may also be
     required to distinguish between various data services, and to classify
     traffic based on other criteria's than just service. As a consequence,
     utilization of the entire range of VLAN p-bit values from 0 to 7 is needed.
     
     More incoming traffic may arrive from the uplink Ethernet interface, than 
     it is possible to forward on the downlink interface. In this case it is 
     important to forward traffic with highest priority first and drop low 
     priority traffic if necessary.
     
     With this table it is possible to configure which receive priority
     (rxPriority) is used for incoming downstream traffic carrying specific
     VLAN p-bit values. It is possible to specify, per VLAN p-bit value, which
     receive priority incoming downstream traffic is allocated to.
     If more than one VLAN tag is included in the received packets, only the first
     VLAN tags priority is taken into account when mapping to receive priority.
     Any packets received without VLAN tag are mapped to the highest receive
     priority (rxPriority=1).

     Below is an illustration of how the VLAN priority could be mapped to the
     receive priorities. The illustration is just and example, any combinations
     of mappings are valid. Note that the number of receive priorities may vary
     from one product to another.
