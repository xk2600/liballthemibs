        When the router went to send a packet, the network interface
        it had been told to send the packet over had packet transmission
        disabled.
        The output discard counter for that network was incremented."

        When the router went to send a packet, the interface output queue was
        too full, and the packet had to be discarded.
        The output overflow counter for that interface was incremented, and

        A packet has not been sucessfully retransmitted.
        The output error counter for that interface is incremented,
        and the packet is discarded. Usually, next_hop_host will be
        the MAC layer address of the next hop router or host that this packet
        is being sent to. The format of this MAC address depends on
        the network type. If next_hop_host starts with an @ (at-sign), then
        that network does not provide formatted display of MAC addresses, and
        the following number is the hex address in router memory that
        the next hop host address is stored at."
