--  rcL3IpSubnet:
--      This group is used to configure and retrieve subnet parameters
--      required for the basic routing functionality.  Before a "L2/L3 hybrid"
--      VLAN or a "L3 only" interface is used for routing, it must be assigned
--      to at least one subnet.  Although ROSE supports multiple subnets per
--      VLAN or L3 interface, ROSE recommends using one subnet per interface.
--
--      Note that the subnet IP address is added indirectly.  It is calculated
--      by logically AND'ing the Agent's IP address (rcL3IpSubnetAgentIpAddr)
--      for this subnet with its subnet mask (rcL3IpSubnetMask).  These
--      subnets are automatically added to the software Routing Table by IP
--      and can be seen in the rcL3IpDynamicRouteTable.
--
--      For a L2/L3 hybrid switch, a static VLAN must be created for the
--      specified rcL3IpSubnetVidIface VLAN ID value before this entry can
--      be used.
--
--      Note that one of the entries for the first interface in this table
--      is directly mapped to the IP address parameters in the ROSE Common MIB
--      (ROSE-COMMON-MIB; i.e., rcCommonIPIpAddress, rcCommonIPNetMask).
--      This allows the initial agent IP address to be set using the serial
--      console, BOOTP, or DHCP.  The remaining subnet entries can be entered
--      using SNMP or the Web management interfaces.

--      This group is independent of the underlying switch hardware and

--      The user can choose to reserve zero, some, or all of the available
--      hardware entries for use as static routes.  The remaining entries,
--      if any, are reserved for dynamic routes (e.g., RIP, OSPF, etc.).
--
--      Note that the default route entry (0.0.0.0) cannot be placed in this
--      table.  If the default route was ever placed into the hardware route
--      table, unknown routes would never be sent to the CPU (i.e., this would
--      prevent new routes from being learned and/or placed into the hardware
--      route table).  The default route is reserved for use by the agent.
