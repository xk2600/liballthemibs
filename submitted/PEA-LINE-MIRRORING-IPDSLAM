   DESCRIPTION
		 "
         This MIB is used to configure end-user line mirroring in the IP DSLAM.
         
         When upstream and downstream traffic mirroring is enabled, all traffic from
         an end-user line is replicated, tagged with an operator specified VLAN
         tag and sent on the IP DSLAM's uplink interface, as illustrated below.

         Different VLANs can be used for upstream and downstream traffic mirroring,
         but the same VLAN may be used for both traffic directions. It is also
         possible to only mirror traffic in one direction, or to start mirroring on
         more than one line.

         The traffic mirroring function will not interfere with the normal services
         as long as the VLAN used for traffic mirroring is not used for services.
         If a mirror VLAN collides with a service VLAN, the behavior is undefined.
