    DESCRIPTION
        "This module defines a MIB for Round Trip Time (RTT) monitoring of a
        list of targets, using a variety of protocols: MIB for management of
        Teldat feature Network Service Monitor.

        The table structure overview is as follows (t: indicates a table,
        at: indicates an augmented table, and it: indicates table with the same
        indices/control as parent table):

        DEFINITIONS:
            conceptual RTT control row -
                This is a row in the 'Overall Control Group'. This row is
                indexed via the teldatNsmCtrlAdminIndex object. This row is
                spread across multiple real tables in the
                'Overall Control Group'.
            probe -
                This is the entity that executes via a conceptual RTT control
                row and populates a conceptual statistics row.
            Rtt operation -
                This is a single operation performed by a probe. This operation
                can be a single Rtt attempt/completion or a group of Rtt
                attempts/completions that produce one operation table entry.

        ARR Protocol Definition:

        The format of the RTT Asymmetric Request/Responses (ARR) protocol is as
        follows:

        The ARR Header (total of 12 octets):

        4 octet -> eyecatcher: 'WxYz'
        1 octet -> version   : 0x01 - protocol version
        1 octet -> command   : 0x01 - logoff request
                               0x02 - echo request
                               0x03 - echo response
                               0x04 - software version request
                               0x05 - software version response
        2 octet -> sequence number (Network Byte Order)
        4 octet -> response data size (Network Byte Order)

        The ARR Data:

        n octets -> request/response data: 'AB..ZAB..ZAB..'

        For software version request/response the protocol version octet will
        contain the version number of the responder. Thus the sequence number,
        etc will not be included.

        The response data should be appended to the origin request data. This
        allows data verification to check the data that flows in both
        directions. If the response data size is smaller than the request data
        size the original request data will be truncated.

        An example would be:
            Request:        /       Response:
            'WxYz'          /       'WxYz'
            0x01            /       0x01
            0x02            /       0x03
            0x0001          /       0x0001
            0x00000008      /       0x00000008
            'ABCDEF'        /       'ABCDEFGH'

        NOTE:   We requested 8 bytes in the response and the response had
                8 bytes. The size of the request data has no correlation to the
                size of the response data.

        NOTE:   For native RTT request/response (i.e. ipIcmpecho) operations
                both the 'Header' and 'Data' will be included. Only the
                'sequence number' in the Header will be valid.

        NOTE:   For non-connection oriented protocol the initial RTT
                request/response operation will be preceded with an RTT
                request/response operation to the target address to force path
                exploration and to prove connectivity. Statistics capture
                table will omit these responses to prevent skewed results."

                              RTT control row is waiting for further control
                              via the teldatNsmScheduleAdminTable. This object
                              can transition to this value via two mechanisms:
                              first by reseting this object, and second by
                              creating a conceptual RTT control row with the

                              its special value.

                              RTT control row is waiting for further control via
                              the teldatNsmScheduleAdminTable. This object can
                              transition to this value via two mechanisms:
                              first by setting this object to 'orderlyStop' or
                              'immediateStop', second by the
                              teldatNsmCtrlOperRttLife object reaching zero.
        active(6)           - This value is not settable and this conceptual
                              RTT control row is currently active.
        restart(7)          - This value is only settable when the state is
                              active. It clears the data of this entry and
                              remain on active state.

        The probes action when this object is set to 'reset':
        - All rows in teldatNsmStatsCaptureTable that relate to this conceptual
          RTT control row (only 1 in current implementation) are destroyed.
        - A single new teldatNsmStatsCaptureTable row is created.
        - teldatNsmCtrlOperRttLife is set to teldatNsmScheduleAdminRttLife.
        - teldatNsmCtrlOperNumRtts is set to zero.
        - teldatNsmCtrlOperTimeoutOccurred,
          teldatNsmCtrlOperOverThresholdOccurred, and
          teldatNsmCtrlOperConnectionLostOccurred are set to false.
        - The next RTT operation is controlled by the objects in the
          teldatNsmScheduleAdminTable.
        - All open connections must be maintained.

        This can be used to synchronize various RTT definitions, so that the
        RTT requests occur simultaneously, or as simultaneously as possible.

        The probes action when this object transitions to 'inactive' (via
        setting this object to 'orderlyStop' or 'immediateStop' or by
        teldatNsmCtrlOperRttLife reaching zero):
        - All statistics and collection information table entries will be
          closed and kept.
        - teldatNsmCtrlOperTimeoutOccurred,
          teldatNsmCtrlOperOverThresholdOccurred, and
          teldatNsmCtrlOperConnectionLostOccurred are set to false.
        - The next RTT request is controlled by the objects in the
          teldatNsmScheduleAdminTable.
        - All open connections are to be closed and cleanup.

        contains a series of 'hop(s)', each 'hop' contains a series of
        'statistics distribution bucket(s)'.

        In current implementation, the rolling accumulated information history
        is maintained only in one hourly 'group'; each 'group' will contained
        only one 'path', each path one 'hop', and each 'hop' one 'statistics
        distribution bucket'.

        Each conceptual statistics row has a current hourly group, into which
        RTT results are accumulated. At the end of each hour a new hourly group
        is created which then becomes current. The counters and accumulators in
        the new group are initialized to zero. The previous group(s) is kept in
        the table until the table contains the maximum number of groups
        established for the conceptual statistics row: in current implementation
        only an hourly 'group' is maintained; at this point, the oldest group
        is discarded and is replaced by the newly created one (as only one group
        is kept, previously groups are deleted). The hourly group is uniquely
        identified by the teldatNsmStatsCaptureStartTimeIndex object.

        If the activity for a conceptual RTT control row ceases because the
        teldatNsmCtrlOperState object transitions to 'inactive', the
        corresponding current hourly group in this table must be 'frozen', and
        a new hourly group created when activity is resumed: in this particular
        case, current hourly group will be deleted and a new one created when
        activity is resumed.

        If the activity for a conceptual RTT control row ceases because the
        teldatNsmCtrlOperState object transitions to 'pending' this whole table
        will be cleared and reset to its initial state.

        Using this teldatNsmStatsCaptureTable, a managing application can
        retrieve summarized data from accurately measured periods, which is
        synchronized across multiple conceptual RTT control rows. With the
        new hourly group creation being performed on a 60 minute period, the
        managing station has plenty of time to collect the data, and need not
        be concerned with the vagaries of network delays and lost PDU's when
        trying to get matching data. Also, the managing station can spread
        the data gathering over a longer period, which removes the need for
        a flood of get requests in a short period which otherwise would occur."

    DESCRIPTION
        "A list of objects which accumulate the results of a series of RTT
        operations over a 60 minute time period.

        The statistics capture table is a rollover table. When
        teldatNsmStatsCaptureStartTimeIndex groups exceeds the maximum
        established value (1), the oldest corresponding hourly group will be
        deleted and will be replaced with the new
        teldatNsmStatsCaptureStartTimeIndex hourly group.

        All other indices will fill to there maximum size. The statistics
        capture table has five indices. Each described as follows:

        - The first index correlates its entries to a conceptual RTT control
          row via the teldatNsmCtrlAdminIndex object.
        - The second index is a rollover group and it uniquely identifies a
          60 minute group. (The teldatNsmStatsCaptureStartTimeIndex object
          is used to make this value unique). Remmber: only one hourly 'group'
          is kept in the table.
        - The third index uniquely identifies the paths in a statistics period.
          (The period is 60 minutes). A path will be created for each unique
          path through the network.
          Note: A path that does not contain the target is considered a
          different path than one which uses the exact same path, but does
          contain the target.
          For all supported values of NsmRttType this index will be one (only
          one path is considered).
        - The fourth index uniquely identifies the hops in each path, as grouped
          by the third index. This index does imply the order of the hops along
          the path to a target.
          For all supported values of NsmRttType this index will be one.
        - The fifth index uniquely creates a statistical distribution bucket.
          In current implementation only one statistical distribution is kept."
