         "
         The IP DSLAM software supports a number of standard 
         and proprietary MIBs.
         This MIB module defines objects for reading out system 
         specific information about the IP DSLAM and the control 
         entries for restarting the IP DSLAM, for setting the 
         alarm filter and for controlling the LEDs.

    DESCRIPTION
    "A non-fatal SW error has been detected on the device. This type of software
     error is normally not fatal for your system, It could be a configuration error
     or a minor problem in the software, so do not panic if this alarm is seen. 
    
     Corrective Actions:
     - Save the alarm information to a file, e.g. using a screenshot. It has to show
       all the trap parameters.
     - Give a brief explanation to how the error was provoked. If it can be provoked
       again, then it is important for the Ericsson support team to know how this is done. 
     - Create a trouble report, which includes the log files, and send it to Ericsson support.
